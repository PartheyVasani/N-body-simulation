# N-body-simulation
This code simulates multiple bodies interacting gravitationally using python. I have used the numpy, matplotlib, and ast libraries. The code uses an imported file has the intial conditions for the system, i.e. the masses, positions and velocities of the bodies. The code plays out rest of their interactions using NumPy. You can tweak the initial conditions or add or remove bodies in the initialCond.csv file, and define the number of bodies you want to run on line 27 of Nbodies.py. Note that in the initialCond.csv file, you have to enter the intial conditions in the format "mass", "initial position", "initial velocity".

# Future work and possible improvements
Right now I am trying to experiment with simulating the orbital resonance in the moons of Jupiter. In terms of efficiency, the code is $O(N^{2})$ where N is the number of bodies. Eventually I want to turn this into an $O(N)$ algorithm in order to make simulations of a large number of interacting bodies, with which I want to simulate the origin of spiral structure in galaxies. This is why I haven't added collision mechanism into the code, since it would not be necessary for galactic scale simulations. Also, for now the units used for calculations are where $G=1$, planet masses are on the scale of $0-100$, and distance scales are of the order $0-250$. I want to work on units I can use for the numbers in the simulation, since SI unit numbers require scrifice of precision.
